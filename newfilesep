Morality is the set of standards that dictate what is right and wrong in terms of behavior and beliefs. Examples of morality include being honest, treating others with respect, helping those in need, and adhering to laws and social norm
Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.”Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee The Art of Expressing the Human Body
